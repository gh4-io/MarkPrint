# Documentation Change Log

Use this file to record every noteworthy documentation change. Each entry should land in the same PR/commit as the docs it references so auditors and AI agents can trace updates quickly.

## How to Log Changes
- Add a new row to the table below for every documentation change (new page, significant revision, restructure, or deprecation).
- Group multiple related files in a single entry when they ship together.
- Reference paths relative to repo root.

## Entries

# Quick Reference Index

## TL;DR
- Start here when you need a successful export in minutes.
- Keep documents under two screens, begin with the problem statement, end with verification steps.
- If a cheat sheet grows beyond this scope, promote it to `docs/full-docs/` and link back.

## Available Cheat Sheets
| Topic | Description | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Quick Start Export](quick-start-export.md) | Requirements + command palette checklist to produce outputs fast. | Active |
| [Build Modes](build-modes.md) | Manual vs auto vs hybrid behavior, how to switch, limitations. | Active |
| [Metadata Fixes](metadata-fixes.md) | Schema troubleshooting, common error patterns, YAML examples. | Active |

> **Note:** Create each cheat sheet as `kebab-case.md` under this folder and add it to the table. Every page must include the standard metadata block and a `## Change History` section.

## How to Contribute
1. Identify the single task the reader must achieve.
2. Provide the minimum commands or UI steps (no narrative detours).
3. Include a verification bullet and link to a deeper guide if the reader needs more context.
4. Update this index and `docs/meta/docs-changelog.md` in the same commit.

## Change History
- 2025-12-06: Added Quick Reference index scaffold (Codex).
